### xray - examine inside the xv6 file system

`xray` is an extension of xv6 that lets you view the file system hierarchy and
inode information. I wrote this for my project for an operating systems class.

To try it out, boot up xv6 on QEMU

```bash
$ make qemu
```

then start up `xray` and see the `help` option.

```bash
$ xray
>> help
```
